Python Problem
Overview
This repository, Python Problem, contains solutions to various Python problems, demonstrating the use of conditional statements, functions, object-oriented programming (OOP), and pattern programming. The goal of this repository is to showcase practical applications of these fundamental programming concepts in Python.
<br>
Topics Covered
Each solution highlights different programming concepts, including:

Conditional Statements: Using if, elif, and else statements to make logical decisions.
Functions: Writing reusable blocks of code with parameters and return values to handle specific tasks.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Creating classes, objects, and methods to model real-world entities and implement modular code.
Pattern Programming: Generating various patterns, often with loops, to illustrate logic and control flow.
<br>
Examples of Problems Solved
<br>
Conditional Statements:
Age-based access control, calculating discounts, etc.
Functions:
Factorial calculation, Fibonacci series, prime checking, etc.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Class-based implementations for banking, student records, etc.
Pattern Programming:
Generating star, number, and alphabet patterns using nested loops.
