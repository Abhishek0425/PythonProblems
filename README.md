<h1>Python Problems</h1>
<br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This repository, <b>Python Problems</b>, offers solutions to various Python challenges. It serves as a practical guide to understanding and implementing key Python programming concepts, including <b>comprehensions</b>, <b>conditional statements</b>, <b>decorators</b>, <b>exception handling</b>, <b>file handling</b>, <b>functions and generators</b>, <b>lambdas</b>, <b>looping</b>, <b>map and filter</b>, <b>object-oriented programming (OOP)</b>, and <b>patterns</b>.
<br>
<h3>Topics Covered</h3>
The repository is organized into sections, each addressing a specific programming concept:
<br>
<b>Comprehensions:</b> Mastering list, set, and dictionary comprehensions for concise and efficient code.
<br>
<b>Conditional Statements:</b> Using <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, and <code>else</code> to implement decision-making logic.
<br>
<b>Decorators:</b> Enhancing the functionality of existing functions in a clean and reusable manner.
<br>
<b>Exception Handling:</b> Writing robust code with <code>try</code>, <code>except</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>finally</code> blocks to handle runtime errors gracefully.
<br>
<b>File Handling:</b> Reading, writing, and manipulating files with Python's built-in file I/O capabilities.
<br>
<b>Functions and Generators:</b> Creating reusable code blocks with functions and generating values on demand using generators.
<br>
<b>Lambda Functions:</b> Utilizing anonymous functions for concise and functional programming.
<br>
<b>Looping:</b> Implementing <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops for repetitive tasks with optimized control flow.
<br>
<b>Map and Filter:</b> Applying functional programming tools to transform and filter data efficiently.
<br>
<b>OOP (Object-Oriented Programming):</b> Leveraging classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism for modular and scalable code.
<br>
<b>Patterns:</b> Generating star, number, and alphabet patterns to demonstrate logic and control flow.
