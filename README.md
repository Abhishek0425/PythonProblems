# PythonProblems

<h1>Python Problem</h1>
<br>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This repository, Python Problem, contains solutions to various Python problems. It demonstrates the use of conditional statements, functions, object-oriented programming (OOP), and pattern programming and aims to showcase practical applications of these fundamental programming concepts in Python.
<br>
<h3>Topics Covered</h3>
<b>Each solution highlights different programming concepts, including:</b>
<br>
<h3>Conditional Statements:</h3> Using if, Elif, and else statements to make logical decisions.
<br>
<h3>Functions:</h3> Writing reusable blocks of code with parameters and return values to handle specific tasks.
<br>
<h3>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</h3> Creating classes, objects, and methods to model real-world entities and implement modular code.
<br>
<h3>Pattern Programming:</h3> Generating various patterns, often with loops, to illustrate logic and control flow.
<br>
<h3>Examples of Problems Solved</h3>
<h3>Conditional Statements:</h3>
Age-based access control, calculating discounts, etc.
<br>
<h3>Functions:</h3>
Factorial calculation, Fibonacci series, prime checking, etc.
<br>
<h3>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</h3>
Class-based implementations for banking, student records, etc.
<br>
<h3>Pattern Programming:</h3>
Generating star, number, and alphabet patterns using nested loops.
<br>
